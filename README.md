This is a personal project made together with a mate by extending a lab project from a course call Advanced Programming Methods.
The application simulates a social network where a user can register, log into his account, manage friends, messages and events.

If the user is new to the app, he can create an account by clicking a Register button:

The user can create his new account by filling the required data, then clicking the button. A confirmation message will be shown if the input is considered to be valid, else an error message will pop up.

Now that the user has created his account, he can log in. The app does the necessary checks to see if the inserted data is correct.
