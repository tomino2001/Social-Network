This is a personal project made together with a mate by extending a lab project from a course call Advanced Programming Methods.
The application, named "Hello!", simulates a social network where a user can register, log into his account, manage friends, messages and events.

If the user is new to the app, he can create an account by clicking a Register button:

![RegisterEnter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83927837/161361512-17f6f5a4-bd2e-436d-a078-83afc3525b11.gif)

The user can create his new account by filling the required data, then clicking the button. A confirmation message will show if the input is considered to be valid, else an error message will pop up.

Now that the user has created his account, he can log in. The app does the necessary checks to see if the inserted data is correct.

After logging in, the user can do all sorts of things. For example, he can try to make new friends:

When receiving a friend request, a user may either accept it, or decline it:

![DeclineFriend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83927837/161362556-a7d9e717-6bea-4432-87b1-6447fd97d381.gif)

If two users don't get along with each other anymore, they can sadly delete themselves from their friends list:

A conversation can be started with just one click:

![InitiateConversation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83927837/161386881-af564a8c-c643-48c9-a4ca-5c907327eb1c.gif)

To reply, the user needs to simply select a message, write a response then send it.

He can also delete messages:
